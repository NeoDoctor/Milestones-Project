This app helps improve the routine care of newborn infants by higlighting important time specific interventions or investigations in neonatal care. 
It takes the infants weight and gestation then applies this to determine if certain interventions or treatments are indicated. Then it will calculate the date they are due and present this information in a table.
User customisable profiles can help users to adjust these thresholds to local guidelines allowing for widespread use.
